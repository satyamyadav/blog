A software engineer !!

**Google is my best teacher and Linux is my best friend !**
I am a FOSS lover and [motivate my friends to use linux](http://satyamyadav.github.io/trylinux) and other open-source softwares and hardwares, always available to help on whatever I can do.

I am all the way ready to chill out with friends any time.
At random I draw ...and listen to music.
